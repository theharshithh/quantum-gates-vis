# Quantum Circuit Visualization

This project provides visualizations for custom gates and specific quantum circuits such as the half adder and full adder using Qiskit, a quantum computing framework in Python.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:theharshithh/quantum-gates-vis.git
   cd quantum-gates-vis.git
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   or
   pip install .

## Usage: 

1. Custom Gate and Rx-Type Gate Visualization
Run the following command to visualize custom gates and Rx-type gates:
   ```bash
   python index.py

2. Half Adder Visualization
Run the following command to visualize the half adder circuit:
   ```bash
   python half_adder.py

3. Full Adder Visualization
Run the following command to visualize the full adder circuit:
   ```bash
   python full_adder.py
